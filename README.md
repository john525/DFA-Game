# DFA-Game
Given the text representation of a regular expression, the user's goal is to create a DFA (deterministic finite automaton) that recognizes the same language of strings. Language equivalence is tested using a method based off the DFA pumping lemma. The game features a dynamic user interface designed to make DFA construction as intuitive and easy as possible. The game can be used as a pedagogical tool to demonstrate the equivalence of all models for regular language description, or as practice for students attempting to solidify their understanding of DFA and regex design.
